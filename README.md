Dog Adoption Analysis

Project Description:

This project is a culumiantion of all the skills I learned in my Python for Data Science certification course through Code Academy. 
I found two .csv files on an open data source that provided data on dog owners (owners.csv) and what went into the owners decision to adopt their dog (dogs.csv).

Using Jupyter Notebooks, I first imported pandas and read the two csv files. I cleaned up both tables before merging them into one table.
The final step is to download the final table in an excel file, NOTE that this step is currently commented out to avoid any unwanted excel downloads.

I have also attached the Excel file I downloaded from Jupyter Notebooks that includes my analysis (dogsandowners_final.xlsx).
